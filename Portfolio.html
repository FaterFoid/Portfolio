Closed 8 years ago.

So I want to :hover on an element and I want the hovering to change an attribute of another class. How do I do it? I want to hover on to a button and it to change other div's display to display: block. I use only HTML and CSS.

What does your HTML look like? What CSS have you tried? –

I have not tried anything, because I don't know how to change another classes attributes in another class.. EDIT: To clarify, I don't even know what to try. –

Without a bare example of the code (even just the markup is a good start) you're trying to use so far, you're unlikely to find much help. Just so you know, however, it's unlikely you can get what you're looking for, as you shouldn't nest a div in a button object, so you won't be able to use parent-child relationships in your CSS to trigger a switch. You'll need to use some Javascript in all likelihood to get this to happen. –

You are limited by css, but there are possibilities with css selectors. I've made you a jsfiddle with a possible solution:

http://jsfiddle.net/6rT3Q/

CSS:

.item1:hover ~ .item3 {
    background-color: red;
}
HTML

<div class="item1">
    Hoverable item
</div>

<div class="item2">
    Dummy item
</div>

<div class="item3">
    Item to change
</div>
Here the ~ tells to look for succeeding el
